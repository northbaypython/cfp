### The North Bay Python 2017 CFP is open!

North Bay Python is seeking speakers of all experience levels, especially first-timers, to contribute to our first-ever conference program! If you use Python professionally or as a hobbyist, or are even just excited about Python or programming and open source in general, we'd love to hear from you.

If you've never presented at a conference before and think you might like to try it, we want to hear from you! The program committee is very much interested in encouraging and supporting new speakers, and we will be able to provide detailed feedback and work with you to develop your proposal and talk content so you can give the best talk possible.

## Dates

## Speakers

North Bay Python is dedicated to featuring a diverse and inclusive speaker lineup.

All speakers will be expected to have read and adhere to the conference [Code of Conduct](linky here). In particular for speakers: slide contents and spoken material should be appropriate for a professional audience including people of many different backgrounds. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate, and neither are language or imagery that denigrate or demean people based on race, gender, religion, sexual orientation, physical appearance, disability, or body size.

We will make every effort to provide accommodations for speakers with differing abilities — all we ask is that you let us know so we can prepare accordingly.

## Talk formats

## Topics

We're happy to help with any of the following:

+ Exploring and brainstorming your interests to help you identify hidden things that would make great talks
+ Connecting you with experienced speakers to help build your proposal and talk
+ Reviewing your outline, slide deck, or presenter notes
+ Connecting you with rehearsal audiences or even just watching you present over a video conference as practice

<!-- TODO schedule and contact info go here -->

## Submitting

To help us evaluate proposals and build our program, we would like as much detail as you can provide on your talk. At a minimum this should include: a brief abstract (~500 characters) suitable for inclusion in a schedule page; a detailed prose summary (intended as the content for a talk detail page on the program site); and at least a rough outline of the structure including estimated timings for each section of your talk.

If you've given your talk before, links to video or slides would be excellent, or if you've blogged about this topic links to your blog posts would be of use as well.

Your speaker profile includes a space for you to describe your prior experience giving talks — this is your chance to talk yourself up and explain why you're the best person in the world to bring us your amazing ideas, so take advantage of it!

## Feedback and mentorship

First time speakers are welcomed and encouraged; if you've never done this before but have an idea please contact the program committee to be connected with a mentor and receive guidance structuring your proposal and talk. Above all we want you to be successful and have a good time telling other attendees about your amazing ideas.
